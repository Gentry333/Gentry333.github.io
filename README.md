## Demo

## What is this?

This is **a theme I'm working on that uses Jekyll's static site generator. I made it in order to integrate Jekyll with Bootstrap-4** so I could test any new features as Bootstrap 4 transitions from alpha to beta.


Jekyll is a simple and blog-aware static site generator built in Ruby. In laymen terms, it's just a tool to let you have **all the cool features of a full-blown CMS without having to worry about managing a database**. This means hosting is *extremely easy* and *scalable* since all you're doing is managing a bunch of files.
