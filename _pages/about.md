# A Jekyll Theme with Bootstrap 4 integration



This is the base Jekyll theme I created with Bootstrap 4 integration. You can find the source code on my github page at [https://github.com/Gentry333/Gentry333.github.io](https://github.com/Gentry333/Gentry333.github.io)

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)
